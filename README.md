**BMI Calculator Documentation**

**BMI Calculator using HTML**

*Description*: This is a web-based BMI calculator that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their weight and height. The calculated BMI is then interpreted to determine whether the individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The interface is styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

*Usage*:
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms and your height in meters.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to see the results.

*Functionality*:
- The calculator takes user input for weight and height using input fields.
- Upon clicking the "Calculate BMI" button, the input is validated and processed.
- The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).
- The calculated BMI is then interpreted to provide a weight category.
- The result is displayed below the button with the calculated BMI and its interpretation.

**BMI Calculator using Python**

*Description*: This is a desktop BMI calculator application built using the Tkinter library in Python. Users can input their weight and height, and the application will calculate the BMI and provide an interpretation of the result. The application's GUI is styled using Tkinter's theming capabilities.

*Usage*:
1. Run the Python script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms and your height in meters.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to see the results displayed on the GUI.

*Functionality*:
- The GUI window displays entry fields for weight and height, as well as a "Calculate BMI" button.
- Upon clicking the button, the user's input is validated.
- If valid, the BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).
- The calculated BMI is then interpreted to provide a weight category.
- The result is displayed on the GUI, including the calculated BMI and its interpretation.

**Shared Functionality**:

Both implementations use similar logic to calculate the BMI and interpret the results based on predefined BMI ranges:
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 <= BMI <= 24.9
- Overweight: 25 <= BMI <= 29.9
- Obese: 30 <= BMI <= 34.9 (Python version also includes 35 <= BMI <= 40)

Both implementations ensure that valid inputs are provided before performing calculations. If invalid or empty inputs are detected, appropriate error messages are displayed.

Both implementations offer an interactive and intuitive user interface to calculate and interpret BMI values quickly. The HTML version is web-based, while the Python version is a standalone desktop application.
